This project demonstrates proficiency in both Frontend and Backend development. Developed a single-page application 'New York City's 6 Iconic Pizzerias' using Vue, HTML5/CSS3 (Grid), and JavaScript. The application is broken down into multiple components and fetches data from a Node server deployed on Heroku. The server hosts data in JSON format, which can be retrieved using MongoDB. The project showcases my ability to create a functional and interactive web application that seamlessly integrates the frontend with the backend.
